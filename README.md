Vulkan Renderer in C (WIP)

This project aims to write a good example of how to implement the renderer fully in C.
It started as a fun little project I wanted to try out. But when looking at references 
I found out everything was written in C++. So I took this as extra motivation to get 
this project out there. Hope you enjoy. Sorry for the lack of comments yet.
